# Project Roadmap

This roadmap is a living plan for how this notebook will grow over time.  
It will evolve as my understanding deepens and as new questions emerge.

---

## Phase 1 — Scaffold and Seed
- Create repo and core structure
- Add README with metaphor first philosophy
- Seed ROADMAP.md
- Seed GLOSSARY.md
- Add .gitkeep files to directories

---

## Phase 2 — Foundations and Core Metaphors
  - Write foundational pages in `01-foundations/`:
  - voltage → motivation difference  
  - current → movement / crowd flow  
  - resistance → narrow hallway / traffic  
  - capacitance → container that fills  
  - inductance → momentum of a moving crowd  
  - noise → background chatter / weather  
  - Add simple ASCII diagrams where helpful
  - Update roadmap as sections are completed

---

## Phase 3 — Analog Operations as Physical Behavior
  - Create pages in `02-analog-operations/`:
  - addition → merging streams  
  - multiplication → volume knob (scaling)  
  - integration → filling a bucket  
  - differentiation → noticing rate of change  
  - oscillation → swings / back-and-forth rhythms  
  - feedback loops → habits  
  - Add at least one simple simulation (Python or JS)

---

## Phase 4 — Bridge to AI and Frontier Hardware
  - Write `04-analog-and-ai/` pages:
  - neurons → little decision-makers  
  - synapses → adjustable trust levels  
  - noise → a feature, not a flaw  
  - continuous dynamics → real-world computation  
  - Write `05-frontier-hardware/` intros:
  - memristors → materials with memory  
  - photonics → patterns of light interacting  
  - neuromorphic chips → silicon brains  

---

## Phase 5 — Simulations and Personal Synthesis
- Add simple simulations in `06-simulations/`
- Use `07-personal-notes/` as a running log of insights
- Refine earlier pages as understanding deepens

---

## Long Term Vision
- A clear, intuitive framework for analog computing  
- A metaphor first explanation of analog AI  
- A public notebook that shows how I think about systems and physics
