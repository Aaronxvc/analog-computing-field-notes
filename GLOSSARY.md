# Glossary (Metaphor First)

This glossary defines key analog computing concepts using **everyday metaphors** first, and technical descriptions second.  
The goal is to make each idea feel physically intuitive before introducing any formalism.

---

## Voltage
**Metaphor:** A *motivation difference* — how badly something “wants” to move from one place to another.  
**Technical:** The electric potential difference that drives current.

---

## Current
**Metaphor:** *Movement* — like people flowing through a hallway or cars moving down a road.  
**Technical:** The rate at which electric charge flows.

---

## Resistance
**Metaphor:** A *narrow hallway* or *traffic jam* — it slows movement and makes it harder to get through.  
**Technical:** A material’s opposition to current flow.

---

## Capacitance
**Metaphor:** A *container that fills up* — like a cup, sponge, or bucket storing something until it spills or changes.  
**Technical:** The ability to store electric charge.

---

## Inductance
**Metaphor:** *Momentum of a moving crowd* — once things are moving, they resist sudden changes.  
**Technical:** The property of a conductor that resists changes in current.

---

## Noise
**Metaphor:** *Background chatter* or *weather* — small random influences you can’t fully control.  
**Technical:** Random fluctuations in a signal or system.

---

## Integration
**Metaphor:** *Filling a bucket over time* — accumulation.  
**Technical:** The mathematical integral implemented physically by capacitors or other accumulators.

---

## Differentiation
**Metaphor:** *How fast something is changing* — like noticing how quickly a car speeds up.  
**Technical:** The mathematical derivative implemented by certain circuit configurations.

---

## Oscillation
**Metaphor:** *A swing going back and forth* — repeating motion.  
**Technical:** A system that cycles between states due to feedback and energy exchange.

---

## Feedback Loop
**Metaphor:** *A habit* — something that reinforces itself (positive) or stabilizes itself (negative).  
**Technical:** A system where outputs influence future inputs.

---

## Neuron (Analog View)
**Metaphor:** A *little decision maker* — it decides whether to pass on a message based on what it receives.  
**Technical:** A nonlinear analog device that integrates inputs and produces an output spike or signal.

---

## Synapse
**Metaphor:** An *adjustable trust level* — a connection that can strengthen or weaken with experience.  
**Technical:** A variable weight connection between neurons.

---

## Memristor
**Metaphor:** A *material with memory* — like a path in grass that deepens the more people walk it.  
**Technical:** A resistor whose resistance depends on the history of current through it.

---

## Photonic Computing
**Metaphor:** *Patterns of light interacting* — like overlapping shadows or reflections.  
**Technical:** Computation performed using light instead of electrons.

---

## InMemory Compute
**Metaphor:** *Weighted material* — the computation happens where the “stuff” already is.  
**Technical:** Performing operations directly inside memory arrays instead of shuttling data around.
