# Analog Computing for Physical Intuition Brains

> **“All models are wrong, but some are useful.” — George Box**  
>
> This repo takes that seriously. Instead of starting with equations, we start with **metaphors, physical intuition, and everyday experiences**. The models here are not perfect, but they are *useful* — and that’s the point.

This repo is a living notebook about analog computing and analog AI — explained in the language of **crowds, containers, movement, habits, temperature differences, and momentum**, not in the language of heavy math.

The goal is simple:

- Explain how **physics itself** can perform computation.
- Build **physical intuition first**, and only then connect to math or formal models.
- Create a bridge between **analog hardware** (memristors, photonics, neuromorphic chips) and **modern AI**.

## Who this is for

- People who think in **systems, flows, and physical intuition** more than equations.
- Software/ML engineers curious about **analog, neuromorphic, or photonic AI**.
- Future collaborators or employers who want to see how I think about **substrate-level computation**.
- Anyone who feels that math‑first explanations often hide the real story.

## How to read this repo

Start with `01-foundations/` for the core metaphors:

- **Voltage → motivation difference** (how badly something “wants” to move)
- **Current → movement or crowd flow**
- **Resistance → narrow hallway or traffic jam**
- **Capacitance → container that fills up**
- **Inductance → momentum of a moving crowd**
- **Noise → background chatter or weather**

Then explore `02-analog-operations/` to see how **math emerges from physical behavior**:

- **Addition → merging streams or crowds**
- **Multiplication → turning a volume knob (scaling)**
- **Integration → filling a bucket over time**
- **Differentiation → how fast something is changing**
- **Oscillation → swings and back‑and‑forth rhythms**
- **Feedback loops → habits and self‑reinforcing behavior**

Other directories:

- `03-analog-computers/` covers historical and conceptual analog machines.
- `04-analog-and-ai/` connects these ideas to **neurons, synapses, and AI systems**.
- `05-frontier-hardware/` looks at **memristors, photonics, and neuromorphic chips** through physical metaphors.
- `06-simulations/` will hold simple digital simulations of analog behavior.
- `07-personal-notes/` is my raw thinking surface: journal entries, design ideas, and open questions.

## Philosophy

- **Physical intuition first.** Every abstract concept should have at least one concrete, everyday physical analogy.
- **Math is optional.** You don’t need calculus or advanced circuit theory to get value here.
- **Honest about reality.** Noise, drift, non‑ideal behavior, and tradeoffs are part of the story, not footnotes.
- **Comfort with ambiguity.** Analog computing is messy and continuous; the goal is not perfection, but *useful* understanding.

This is not a finished textbook. It’s a **living field notebook** as I build my own understanding of analog computing and its role in AI.
